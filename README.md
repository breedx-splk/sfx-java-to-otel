How to migrate from signalfx-java yammer/codahale to OpenTelemetry.

In July 2023, we announced the end of support date for `signalfx-codahale` and
`signalfx-yammer`. These SignalFx libraries originally helped with people using
Dropwizard metrics (also previously called yammer or codahale) to deal with 
and get data into SignalFx. This is no longer a supported option, and Splunk
strongly encourages users to switch to OpenTelemetry for their metrics solutions.
This migration guide is intended to help users understand how they may 
leverage OpenTelemetry Java to replace their usages of `signalfx-codahale`
and `signalfx-yammer` in their projects.
